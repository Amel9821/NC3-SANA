NC3 Apps
This project was created for completing the challenge in Apple Developer Academy. It is An apple watch game that uses the screen display feature as a method of refreshment for Kpop fans. 
KoPlay is a stand alone app, but inspired by our iOS app KOPCard. Even though it's different, they both aim to increase Kpoperâ€™s happiness level. The KoPlay focuses on music and can be used at events and even when fans are home alone. Anyone who loves Kpop music and a fun game can be delighted by our app.
